### ABOUT<br>
------
I am self-leading and determined person, and I believe in continuous learning. I am the person, who always asks “how can we do this easier/better/faster”. <br>
<br>
For my background I am a mechanical engineer (2019), and worked on that field until spring 2024. Couple of years ago I got interested in data engineering, analytics and programming. I was determined to learn the basics I 
needed to start my studies – and so did I.<br>
<br>
I studied Python basics on my own during the summer 2023 and started my DA&AI studies in JAMK University of Applied Sciences 9/2023. I completed my 16 credits in December 2023. I kept on learning more about Python and SQL during the winter and in April 2024 I started working as a data trainee in Mastos Oy. This training is part of my recuitment training in Saranen Consulting Group. I have contiuned my studies all this time and I have for example completed two Udemy certifications: one about SQL & PostgreSQL and the other about Apache Airflow.<br>
<br>
At my free time I train my dog and like to spend time in nature. I am a keen photographer. I do lot of handicrafts, especially knitting, and I have made my own knitting designs and instructions. I dream about my own knitting book.<br>
